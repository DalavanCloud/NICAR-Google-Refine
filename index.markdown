# Google Refine for Investigative Journalism

*An introduction to one of the best data tools for any reporter of any technical level*


This is a hands-on walkthrough for [NICAR 2012](http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar-2012/). It will take place on **Friday**, from **2 &ndash; 2:50PM** in the **Jeffersonian/Knickerbocker** room. It will be led by Dan Nguyen ([@dancow](http://twitter.com/dancow)) with help from Joe Kokenge ([@josephkokenge](http://twitter.com/josephkokenge)) of ProPublica.

You'll learn some of the basic (yet very powerful) features and we'll even do some examples of interesting journalism. No statistics, programming, or Excel skill required. Watch the [official video tutorials here](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/). Read [my tutorial I wrote showing how Refine was essential](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/using-google-refine-for-data-cleaning "Chapter 1. Using Google Refine to Clean Messy Data - ProPublica") in our award-winning [Dollars for Docs investigation](http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/) at ProPublica.

## A tool for cleaning and investigations

[Google Refine](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/) is called: "a power tool for working with messy data" 

If you haven't tried Refine yet, then you're missing out on the potential stories and insights that Refine can easily (and sometimes exclusively) find in data. 

It doesn't matter what skill level you have. Refine, which works right out of your browser (and offline) is one of those unique tools that is as equally useful to those who have never left their click-and-drag interfaces as it is to the most anal-retentive detail-oriented data analysts and command-line-loving power programmers.

In this lesson, I'll start at the very basics: opening a file with Refine, doing basic sorting, searching (things that you can do in Excel, of course) to its easy-to-use data cleaning methods and then to how Refine can help you probe unfamiliar datasets to scout out a story.


### The Dilemma 
There are, of course, about an unlimited number of ways that a dataset will do its best to raise your blood pressure. The two situations I'll cover are:

* You pretty much know exactly what you're trying to find but you have no idea how messy/dirty the data is and if it's even cleanable

* You don't even really know what's in the data or what you should be doing with it. You just want a really easy way to explore it.


### The Data
The two datasets I will be working with are:

* [FEC Individual Contribution Data](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#a2011_2012) &ndash; the list of citizens who have individually contributed $200+ to the political process

* The [White House Visitor Logs](http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/visitor-records) &ndash; everyone who has visited the White House during the Obama Administration (in the time period it chose to disclose), who they visited, and (sometimes) why.

(hopefully we'll have time to do both)
